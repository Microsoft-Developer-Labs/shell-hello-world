# Hello World in Shell Script
Feel free to copy and share.

Shell script is commonly known on non-Windows OS's (example: UNIX). This has an extension __.sh__ and is like a __.exe__ file in Windows, but for that specific OS.

In order to run these shell scripts, open a terminal and simply type:

`./Program.sh` - Program is a custom name you can choose.

Today we will output the message hello world!
